            <ul>
              <li>2020 was the strongest year, with sales consistently growing each quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
              <li>Q4 2020 saw the highest revenue ($1.25M in December 2020), making it the best-performing period.</li>
              <li>January 2021 ($1.03M) also maintained strong sales, though a downward trend started afterward.</li>

      <strong>Sales Revenue</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Sharp Decline in Q4 2022 – A Major Sales Anomaly <ul>
            <li>Historically, Q4 (Oct-Dec) has been the strongest quarter due to holiday shopping (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas sales). However, in 2022, <strong>Q4 sales plummeted</strong>. </li>
            <li>December 2022 Sales Revenue was $262K (Previous years: $458K–$1.25M). This represents a <strong>~70-80% drop</strong> from Q4 2021 and an even sharper decline compared to Q4 2020. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Post-Pandemic Sales Normalization (2020-2022 Trends) <ul>
            <li>2020 Sales Surge: The pandemic led to a significant boost in eCommerce sales, with Q2-Q4 2020 seeing a rapid increase (e.g., <strong>Q4 2020 was nearly double Q4 2019</strong>). </li>
            <li>2021 Slight Slowdown: Sales remained high but started stabilizing, showing a decline from peak pandemic levels.</li>
            <li>2022 Major Decline: A <strong>consistent drop in sales across all quarters</strong> suggests a post-pandemic correction, with inflation, lower consumer spending, or increased competition. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Declining Growth Throughout 2022 – Indicating Weak Consumer Demand <ul>
            <li>Each quarter in 2022 experienced a downward trend.</li>
            <li>Q1: Started fairly strong ($704K in Jan) but lower than 2021.</li>
            <li>Q2 - Q3: Dropped further, below $500K per month and continued decline through Q3 with Aug/Sep below $400K.</li>
            <li>Q4: <strong>Historic low, indicating critical demand issues</strong>. This suggests customer retention, pricing, or product-market fit issues. TechSphere may need to re-strategize through marketing, promotions, or change in pricing. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Average Order Value</strong>
      <ol>
        <li> Sharp AOV Surge in 2020, followed by a Decline in 2021-2022 <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>2020 saw the highest AOV growth, peaking at $322 (Oct 2020)</strong> compared to $246 (Nov 2019), aligning with pandemic-driven eCommerce boom.
            </li>
            <li>Post-pandemic correction (2021-2022) led to a steady decline, with AOV in 2022 returning close to 2019 levels (~$234-$237).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>2022 AOV is lower and relatively more volatile compared to previous years <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>2022 AOV fluctuates significantly </strong> between $216 (Oct) and $256 (Sep).
            </li>
            <li>Q4 2022 AOV is significantly lower than Q4 2020 & 2021, meaning holiday spending per order has dropped.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Long-Term AOV Decline May Indicate Price Sensitivity <ul>
            <li>From a peak of ~$322 in 2020, AOV steadily dropped to ~$234 in 2022 which is 27% drop.</li>
            <li>Over the span of four years, the change in AOV growth has been relatively constant, indicating minimal changes in product pricing (as illustrated in Sales Growth vs. AOV Growth below).</li>
            <li>AOV in 2022 is likely not a major factor in the decline of sales that year.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Order Count</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Order counts closely follow sales revenue, indicating that the decline in revenue is primarily due to <strong>fewer orders</strong> rather than a drop in AOV in 2022. </li>
        <li>Total orders <strong>dropped by 38%</strong> from 2021 to 2022. </li>
        <li>The sales anamoly and decline <strong>started in mid-2022</strong>, with orders falling from 2,034 in July to just 825 in October. </li>
        <li>While people are spending slightly less per order, the <strong>decline in order frequency</strong> directly results in lower sales revenue. </li>
